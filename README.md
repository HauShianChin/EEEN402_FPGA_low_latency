# EEEN402_FPGA_low_latency
VHDL projects

Academic experience of VHDL.

Project 1: Created an 7SD that runs off a binary counter. First experience with structural design. 

Project 2: Demonstrates my understanding of dataflow design, structural design, behavioral design and a combination of the previous 3

Project 3: Generates function, procedures and testbenches. Observed the efficacy of combinatorial and sequential logic with these 2 objects using a testbench

Project 4: Developed a Moore state machine using sequential logic 

Project 5: Implemented a double-digit SSD along with a 1 second blinking LED using Vivado IP catalogue. 

Project 6: Using Vivado IP catalogue, the MicroBlaze microprocessor can be instantiated onto the FPGA and leveraged using the HDL wrapper. This was later used to program hello world using the Vitis interface for an abstracted usage of the FPGA

Project 7: Fashioned a PWM IP on Vivado IPI 

Project 8: Synthesised an 8 bit music player using a PWM IP and the MicroBlaze softcore processor. Able to play Il Vento Doro.
