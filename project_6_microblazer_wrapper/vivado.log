INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [d:/GitHub/EEEN402_FPGA_low_latency/project_6_microblazer_wrapper/project_6.gen/sources_1/bd/Lab6_1/ip/Lab6_1_mdm_1_0/Lab6_1_mdm_1_0.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/Lab6_1_wrapper_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/Lab6_1_wrapper_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
